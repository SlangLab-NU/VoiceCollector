## Welcome to Voice Collector! 🎙️

Hello there! We're thrilled to have you here. Our application is not just any ordinary data collection platform. We're on a mission to make voice recognition inclusive for everyone, especially for those with speech impairments.

### **Why is Our Dataset Special? 🌟**

1. **A Heart for Impaired Speakers**: Our platform stands out because it focuses on impaired speakers, making sure their voices are heard and recognized.

2. **A Treasure Trove of Data**: We're proud to offer a dataset packed with high-quality audio from dysarthria speakers, detailing different severity levels. As of now, this is the most extensive public dataset in this unique domain.

3. **Powered by Cutting-Edge Tech**: We've embraced wav2vec 2.0, a top-notch pre-trained speech recognition model, to refine our validation process. This ensures pristine data quality and also provides additional insights like intelligibility scores.
